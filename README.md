# About :
This repository contains code for CNN model which is train with preturbed inputs. Basic interpretation visualization is also preformed.  
What is Adversial attack?

Adversarial machine learning is a technique employed in the field of machine learning which attempts to fool models through malicious input.This technique can be applied for a variety of reasons, the most common being to attack or cause a malfunction in standard machine learning models.

Training with preturbed input is straight-forward way to deal with adversial attack. 
This project focuses on building robust CNN model and trying to gain insight of model by using different interpretation technique.
(Still working on few interpretation technique. We will update once done)
